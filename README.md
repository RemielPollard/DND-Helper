This is a simple application that allows you to do three things:

1. Roll dice - choose die type, how many, and add any + modifiers
2. Generate DND ability scores - roll 4d6 x6, drop lowest roll. Choose a mulligan and the app will reroll anything that rolls under that number. App will reroll all attributes if none are 16 or higher.
3. Dynamic attribute score generator using buy point method - different games, especially video games, have a different number of attributes with different buy point arrays available. Some of them also increase the buy point cost after a certain attribute score is reached. For example, Fallout has 7 attributes, DND has 6. In order to increase your score from 13 to 14, it costs 2 pts, not 1. This allows you to generate scores based on the rules as you input them.
